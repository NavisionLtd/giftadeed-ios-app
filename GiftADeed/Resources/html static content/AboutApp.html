<h><b><big>Scientific Research on giving</big></b></h></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b>Scientific research provides compelling data to support the anecdotal evidence that giving is a powerful pathway to personal growth and lasting happiness.
Through fMRI technology, we now know that giving activates the same parts of the brain that are stimulated by food and sex.
Experiments show evidence that altruism is hardwired in the brain—and it's pleasurable.
Helping others may just be the secret to living a life that is not only happier but also healthier, wealthier, more productive, and meaningful.

<h><b><big>Inspiration behind Gift-A-Deed App</big></b></h></p>
    <h id="backgroundTxt"><b><big>Background of Gift-a-Deed</big></b></h></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b>Gift of a basic necessity of food, water, clothing, shelter etc all, to a Needy anywhere anytime.<br><br>
    Gift of a platform to enable you do a Good-Deed today, without depending on any one organization or gov't. This is as they say in sharing economy, " <u>Democratization of Charity</u>".<br><br>
    Deed of doing good, or simply a Good Deed of helping a fellow human being for basic necessities of life, which nature out to have made it free for everyone.<br><br>
    Even Birds and Animals get the basic necessities of life free from nature, be it a wild Jungle or in vastness of the Oceans; a nest for bird in a Tree, or the wild grass lands for Herbivores animals to graze on or for that matter for a Fish in an Ocean of water. <br><br>
    Why then in a Human civilized world Jungle we have extreme Have &amp; Have-nots.<br><br>
    If we show compassion and share these basic necessities, which Animals have no problem sharing, wouldn't the world be a better place?<br><br>
    We believe it will be, thus was born the seed of this idea. Do a Good Deed today by Gifting a Need.<br><br>

    <h><b><big>Motivational quotes on Giving</big></b></h></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b>1. A Chinese proverb:<br><br>
    “If you want happiness for an hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.” For centuries, the greatest thinkers have suggested the same thing: Happiness is found in helping others.<br><br>
    2. For it is in giving that we receive — Saint Francis of Assisi<br><br>
    3. The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity — Leo Tolstoy<br><br>
    4. We make a living by what we get; we make a life by what we give — Winston Churchill<br><br>
    5. Making money is a happiness; making other people happy is a <b><i>super happiness</i></b> — Nobel Peace Prize recipient Muhammad Yunus<br><br>
    6. Giving back is as good for you as it is for those you are helping, because giving gives you purpose. When you have a purpose-driven life, you’re a happier person — Goldie Hawn<br><br>
    7. According to Harvard scientist Michael Norton, “Giving to a cause that specifies what they’re going to do with your money leads to more happiness than giving to an umbrella cause where you’re not so sure where your money is going.”

    Fulfillers/Donors - can Gift a Need by simply using the app to find a Need they want to give.<br><br>
    To find a Need simply by opening the app and finding need icons (for food, water, clothes, shelter ) closest to their location. Just select the need by gently tapping the icon and then simply click on the Map icon on bottom right corner of the Map to take you to the location of the need. You may choose to display the picture of your gift by clicking on
    picture icon or by browse through your pictures.<br><br>

    There are 3 winners at the end of every donation of a Gift<br><br>
    Tagger, who did a Good deed by tagging the needy location.<br><br>
    Fulfillers, who did a Good deed by using the Tagged need location to fulfill the need.<br><br>
